## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm David, a business intelligence analyst student

Currently, I'm pursuing an exciting career transition into data analysis through TripleTen's intensive program, where I'm mastering Excel, SQL, Python, and business intelligence tools. This journey represents a natural evolution â€“ I've always been drawn to understanding patterns and finding solutions, and now I'm developing the technical skills to do it through data.

What I bring to the table:
â€¢ Strong customer service background with proven problem-solving abilities
â€¢ Academic experience in consulting, case management, and HR strategy
â€¢ Excellent communication skills developed through retail and client interactions
â€¢ Fresh perspective on data analysis informed by real-world customer experience
â€¢ A Masters in Human Resource Management from Golden Gate University

I'm excited to combine my strategic consulting background with emerging data analysis skills to help organizations turn their data into competitive advantages. Whether it's optimizing recruitment processes, analyzing marketing performance, or uncovering operational efficiencies, I'm passionate about making data work for business success.

Currently open to: Entry-level data analyst positions, internships, and networking opportunities in the data analytics space.
